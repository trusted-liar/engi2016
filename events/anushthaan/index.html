                        <div class="info-row">Indian classical dance is an umbrella term for various codified art forms rooted in sacred Hindu musical theatre styles and was considered a higher form of art and was practiced in courts, temples and on special occasions. Folk dance forms, on the other hand, were and are still practiced in groups in rural areas as an expression of the daily work and rituals of the common people during festivals. Anushthaan, organized by Nrityangana, The Classical Dance Society of DTU, truly depicts the glorified culture and traditions of India. With performances ranging from Gujarat's Garba to Punjab’s Bhangra, from the mesmerizing moves of Bharatnatyam to the graceful Kathak, the classical and folk dance competition, Anushthaan, has been and will continue to add colours to the Engifest.
