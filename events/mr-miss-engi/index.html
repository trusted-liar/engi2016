The online preliminary round is open, so email your best picture before February 10, 2016 to engifest2016@gmail.com with your name and college, and a caption describing yourself; and we’ll upload them here. Try to get the maximum likes possible on your picture (Note: A like is counted only if the Engifest page has been liked too).
10 Girls and 10 Boys will be selected from the online round on the basis of the number of likes and will participate on the final day of event.
